XNA Test Game

This game is an exercise into the XNA framework.  Currently all of the code has been done by following the Star Defense
Tutorial Series found at xnaresources.com (Website: http://www.xnaresources.com/default.asp?page=TUTORIALS)

All credit for the current code is given to Kurt Jaegers.
Kurt has written several books regarding the XNA Framework.
I am in no way afflicated with Kurt, but am very grateful for his on-line Tutorials and his books.
